# My Fitness Journey

## Purpose and Goals

The purpose of My Fitness Journey is to improve gym member retention by creating member
accountability and improving consistency. The app accomplishes that goal by providing trainers with
a way to monitor member progress and to provide feedback and encouragement. With encouragement and
knowledge that their progress is being watched, members are more likely to be consistent and more
likely to return year over year. Returning members are also more likely to purchase membership
add-ons such as a family membership, kids activities, or group classes.
